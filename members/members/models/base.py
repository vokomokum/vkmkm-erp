# The DBSession is for working with SQLAlchemy models (strictly
# preferrable to raw SQL). It makes a lot of regular programming tasks
# in web-app development very easy.
# Working on DB-related objects will lead to SQL statements that
# SQLAlchemy creates (e.g. changing a members' city leads to an UPDATE
# statement on the members table).
# Views can create objects from the DB using the session very easyly
# and straightforward. They do not need to do anything with objects
# in the session but adding, deleting or changing them.
# All changes made on objects that are in the session will
# automatically be commited to the DB at the end of a successful request.
#
# What is commiting?
# -------------------
#   A commit makes all SQL statements within a transactions permanent.
#   If one statement fails, the whole transaction is rolled back.
#   In our context, all that happens within one request is our
#   transaction.
#   Pyramid (via SQLAlchemy and the ZopeTransactionExtension)
#   commits all changed objects in the session after the request has
#   successfully been processed. This is by design, to simplify and
#   reduce transaction handling (see e.g.
#   http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.pylons.general/15295)
#   The consequence is that views should simply raise Exceptions (caught
#   by views.base.ErrorView) if anything goes wrong and can rely on a rollback.
#
# What is flushing?
# -------------------
#  A session can be flushed at any point, which simulates a commit on
#  the model in the session. It will fail if the commit would fail
#  (given that the data model in pyramid corresponds to the DB)
#  and it will update things like new IDs coming from auto-increment
#  tables.
#  We set autoflush=True, because this way database errors (e.g. a
#  constraint violation) cause an Exception before the request ended.
#  Then our catch-all ErrorView can still catch it.
#  Read more about autoflush and autocommit settings here:
#  http://mapfish.org/doc/tutorials/sqlalchemy.html#create-the-session
#
# Raw SQL
# ------------------
# Raw SQL can be executed on the session, though it should only be done when
# not possible on the SQLAlchemy model. Here is an example:
# res = DBSession.execute('''SELECT * from workgroups;''')
# print list(res)[0].name

DBSession = scoped_session(sessionmaker(autoflush=True, autocommit=False))
register_for_transaction_mgmt(DBSession)

# this is used as base model class for SQLAlchemy models
Base = declarative_base()
